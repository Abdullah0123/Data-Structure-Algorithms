# What is time & space complexity?
Time & space complexity of an algoritm is very important as it defines the efficiency of an algorithm.

There are multiple ways to solve a problem. e.g. there are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers. but how we analyse which is most efficient agorithm.

Generally we talk about perofomance in absoulte measures. for example i run 100m in 12s so i will be faster then other who complete in 15s.

But we can not measure an algorithm efficiency in absolute manners as it depends on multiple factors such as language used, os, memory etc.

We have to find time complexity as how long does an algorithm take for a function of input size and
space complexity as how much space it used for function of input size.

By analyzing space and time compexity the comparison will be machine independent. if your app needs to be very quick and has a lot of memory then you do need to worry about space and vice versa.

# Representing space & time complexty.
We represent space and time complexity with big O for worst case, omega for best case and theta for average case.
