# What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions that perform some operation on an input and gives an output or it is a set of instructions that solve a particular problem.

For example in order make a tasty dish a person need the ingredients then he/she follw the recipe of that dish
and the output will be a tasty dish.

In terms of programming if we want to add 2 numbers we take 2 numbers as input then add them with + opertaor and return the sum. 

# Characteristic is an algorithm?
An algorithm has well defined inputs and output.
Each step in an algorithm should be clear and unambiguos.
It should be language independent.

# Why algorithms?
As a developer we may come accross various problems that we need to solve.
Learning those algorithms help us solve problems efficiently.
Every algorithms with its own tradeoffs.
