# Big O notation
The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented by big O notation.

The big O notaton describes complexity using algebraic terms e.g (n, n2, n3, logn)

It is expressed in terms of input.

It focuses on the bigger picture and ignore minute details e.g. if time complexity is n+2 it ignores 2 and focus on n only i.e. O(n)
